In this project I plot the Global_active_power, Global_reactive_power, Voltage ~ date/time, etc .

There are three R scripts "plot1.R", "plot2.R" and "plot3.R" to generate the following three PNG files.


* plot1.png is histgram of Global_active_power.
* plot2.png is plot of Global_active_power/ Global_reactive_power/ Voltage ~ datetime.
* plot3.png is plot of submeter ~ datetime.
